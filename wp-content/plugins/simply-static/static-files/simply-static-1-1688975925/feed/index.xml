<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kiddypi.com/" target="_blank"><strong>KiddyPi</strong></a>&nbsp;is a learning brand in Bengaluru. Our courses, workshops and educational kits complement children’s formal learning in science and technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parallely, we also aim at building true human qualities in children.</p>



<p>We believe that yoga has all-round benefits for children. In keeping with this, on 7th August, 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM, we are organising a&nbsp;<strong>free&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>unique&nbsp;</strong>online workshop for children named,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/kiddypi1/status/1422843219767746562/photo/1" target="_blank"><strong>Yoga + Tech – Part 2</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The workshop is the sequel to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/kiddypiclub/photos/a.168389426887060/1409325152793475/" target="_blank"><strong>International Yoga Day Special workshop</strong></a>&nbsp;that we had conducted on&nbsp;<strong>19th June, 2021&nbsp;</strong>from&nbsp;<strong>3:00 PM to 4:30 PM, IST</strong>. The last workshop was a huge success with students and their parents. All participants were keen to learn yoga.</p>



<p>Have a look at some beautiful moments from the event, captured as pictures below:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">India has stepped into the 75th year of Indian independence. She has successfully overcome many natural and manmade crises. Thanks to the undying spirit of her countrymen. India will also fight back and overcome the COVID crisis. Both the government of India and private players are doing their best. On this occasion,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kiddypi.com/" target="_blank"><strong>KiddyPi</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>a STEM academy (STEM stands for Science, Technology Engineering, Mathematics) based in Bengaluru has rolled out attractive discount offers, the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/kiddypiclub/photos/a.168389426887060/1464654330593890/" target="_blank"><strong>Great Freedom Discounts</strong></a>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Education has been badly hit due to closure of schools, rapid transition from classroom to online setup, job loss or reduction of parents’ salary, lack of devices to attend online classes, etc.&nbsp;<strong>KiddyPi’s&nbsp;</strong>discount offers will certainly reduce the funding concerns.</p>

<li>Small batches will receive one-to-one attention from mentors. Weekly five-sessions per course will be offered. Students can register for multiple levels of the same course or can opt for different courses.</li>



<li>Each session includes an exciting mini-project. All of the courses are customised and cater to the requirements of the present educational and professional worlds. Mini-projects offer hands-on learning and exposure to real-life challenges.</li>



<li>Daily feedback reports keep parents aware of the progress of children along with some areas of improvement.</li>

<p><strong>“Ganpati Bappa Moraya,</strong></p>



<p><strong>Agle Baras Tu Jaldi Aa!”</strong></p>



<p><br>These 2 lines of farewell wish have offered solace to generations of Bappa lovers at the time of&nbsp;<strong>‘Ganapati Visarjan’</strong>. This year too, we bid adieu to Bappa on&nbsp;<strong>‘Anant Chaturdashi’</strong>.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kiddypi.com/" target="_blank"><strong>KiddyPi</strong></a>&nbsp;conducted the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/kiddypi1/status/1438173779255967744/photo/1" target="_blank"><strong>Ashtavinayak Special</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>workshop during the 10-days long ‘<strong>Ganpati Utsav’</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>108 Names of ‘Bappa’! How many do you know??</strong></p>



<p>Sometimes, many of us misunderstand our next generations. We think that they know very little about our culture and heritage.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kiddypi.com/kpicore/contact.html" target="_blank"><strong>Team KiddyPi</strong></a>&nbsp;has always been pleasantly surprised by our talented students. We have seen that they know quite a lot about ‘<strong>Bharatiya Sanskriti</strong>’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kiddypi_ashtavinayak-templesofindia-temples-activity-6843940921130700801-rH11/" target="_blank"><strong>Ashtavinayak Special&nbsp;</strong></a>workshop began with an interesting chit-chat with little participants. &nbsp;In the workshop, kids wrote multiple names of Lord Ganesh as a part of an activity.&nbsp;<strong>Team KiddyPi&nbsp;</strong>also participated in it and celebrated the quintessential spirit of a child, hidden somewhere in our hearts.</p>



<p>Only a few people can vouch for never having bunked classes in their schools and colleges, right?&nbsp;Mostly, students bunk those classes, they consider as boring.</p>



<p>Learning without fun is not only boring but also ineffective to a great extent! Fun and learning are our greatest priorities. They are integral features of our weekend workshops and regular courses.</p>



<p><strong>‘My Most Memorable Ganpati Utsav!’</strong></p>



<p>Remember how we used to celebrate grand ‘Ganpati Utsav’ before the pandemic? The magnificent ‘Ganpati Murti’ of Lalbaug (<strong>‘Lalbaugcha Raja’)</strong>&nbsp;would always fascinate us with its gigantic size and aura.</p>



<p>Chanting of ‘Mantras’, ringing of bells, blowing of the conch shells amidst the air, heavy with the fragrance of flowers and incense sticks – blissful and happy souls all around.</p>



<p>Beautifully decorated pandals, colourful lighting and lip-smacking food stalls would keep children busy.</p>



<p>We walked down memory lane when children shared their lovely memories of ‘Ganpati Utsav’ through creative writing.</p>



<p><strong>To be continued…</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ashtavinayak Special&nbsp;</strong>workshop went on to the next stages of excitement. The best ones are yet to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stay tuned for the next sequel of the blog.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ganpati Utsav</strong>&nbsp;ushers in the season of festivals in India. We say&nbsp;<strong>‘Shri Ganesh’</strong>&nbsp;before starting every good activity. It is believed that on seeing his complete devotion towards himself and Devi Parvati, Lord Shiva blessed Lord Ganesh that his puja will be performed before any other puja.</p>



<p>Children loved these stories discussed at&nbsp;<a href="https://kiddypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>KiddyPi’s</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>‘Ashtavinayak Special’ workshop. The ways to learn about culture, heritage and philosophy need not be bland. Games, quiz rounds and contests can set the tempo of workshops on topics of traditional values as well.</p>



<p><strong>How Well Do You Know Your Lord Ganesh?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lord Ganesh is integrally associated with our popular culture. Movies, ‘Bhakti Sangeet’ and TV serials also spread&nbsp;<strong>‘Ganesh Mahima’&nbsp;</strong>across the country. However, when it is specifically about the ‘Ashtavinayak’, there are many hidden gems not yet exposed to the widespread culture!</p>



<p>Our quiz round was aimed at spreading the information on ‘Ashtavinayak’ and packing it up with the thrill of a contest. As the workshop prerequisite, we had mentioned that the quiz round would theme around the beliefs and legends surrounding the ‘Ashtavinayak’ temples and ‘Swayambhu Ganpati Murti’.</p>



<p>The participants prepared accordingly.</p>



<p>Also during the presentation round, we had discussed many of the quiz questions without giving the participants a hint of them of course.</p>



<p><strong>The Intriguing ‘Laddu’ And The Baby Elephant!</strong></p>



<p>Lord Ganesh likes ‘Modak’ and ‘Laddu’. Children drummed up lots of excitement when they learnt to create an&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://kiddypiblog.wordpress.com/2021/10/04/a-fascinating-laddu/">animated story</a></strong>&nbsp;of an intriguing ‘laddu’ and a baby elephant.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kiddypi-online.teachable.com/p/scratch-programming-for-beginners" target="_blank"><strong>Scratch Programming</strong></a>&nbsp;is the gift of innovative coding ideas where even beginners can join workshops, code and build simple animated programs. Designed especially for kids, Scratch Programming uses drag-and-drop elements to build codes and run programs.</p>



<p><strong>Coding Contest Showstoppers!</strong></p>



<p>The team of mentors at KiddyPi have coached some super talented students. They scored very good&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSqnFLqDI4R/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>ranks</strong></a>&nbsp;at the international coding contests. We watched the project videos and discussed how our workshop participants can also build such outstanding projects with the proper guidance from our mentors. &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>We are holding our next workshops themed around&nbsp;<strong>Navaratri Koluvu.&nbsp;</strong>Instead of a court of toys, we will have&nbsp;<strong>a court of robots</strong>&nbsp;built by our exceptional students under the guidance of our mentors.</p>

<p>Children learnt about movements of sprites (animated characters) along the ‘X’ and ‘Y’ coordinates. Some of the participants already knew&nbsp;<strong>Scratch Programming</strong>. They improvised codes and added their imagination to their storylines.</p>



<p>The story concept was how to add the spirit of challenge in the game! The laddu wouldn’t be simply served to the baby elephant. It has to use its brain to get hold of it!</p>



<p>Children created their own sets of challenges by improvising the codes. It was a super successful coding event. Children loved every bit of it.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our upcoming&nbsp;<strong>Navaratri Special Workshop&nbsp;</strong>where some of the coolest Robos built by our students will be exhibited. Get ready to welcome&nbsp;<strong>‘Robo Koluvu’</strong>&nbsp;in your home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">Hello li’l friends,</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We hope that you spent a lovely Navratri with your near and dear ones (maintaining the COVID protocols). Many of you were also preparing for exams scheduled right after the Navratri vacations. In keeping with the festive-learning vibe, team&nbsp;<a href="https://kiddypi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>KiddyPi</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>brought a unique kids activity event –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/kiddypiclub/photos/a.168389426887060/1503424660050190/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Robo Koluvu</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>In case you missed it, please read on to feel the excitement that we had in the live session!&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Robo Golus </strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Navratri Bommai Golu&nbsp;</strong>in Tamil is the beautiful arrangement of figures of Devis &amp; Devtas. During Navratri, people create such arrangements in homes, do Pujas and bask in the divine presence. The tradition is known by different names in different parts of India. In Telugu, it is known as&nbsp;<strong>Bommala Koluvu&nbsp;</strong>and in Kannada it is known as&nbsp;<strong>Bombe Habba.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/v3vPQeQRGvs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Robo Koluvu</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>instead of a court of toys, we created a court of robos out of&nbsp;<a href="https://kiddypi-online.teachable.com/p/m-bot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>mBots</strong></a>, Codey Rockies, Beebots, Code-a-pillars, Kiddyblocks, Hovercrafts and Airblocks.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants chose their preferred robots and we showed them the maneuverings with thorough explanations. However, the right to choose had to be earned by the participants.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you can expect nothing but excitement at every step of our special events/ weekend workshops/ regular sessions, the right to choose concept was also not devoid of a thrill learning activity. For this, participants cracked a quiz round and the top 3 got the right to choose their favourite robos from the Koluvu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Participants opted for the hovercraft drone, Codey Rocky and mBot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The Hovercraft Drone</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Programmable and transformable hovercraft showcased in the event, was not only entertaining but also educational. First thing first, coming to the entertainment factor, it allows for DIY trials and children can build their own hovercrafts by readjusting the parts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Secondly, children and teens can learn coding (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kiddypi-online.teachable.com/p/scratch-programming-for-beginners" target="_blank"><strong>Scratch Programming</strong></a>) and aerodynamics too. They can learn to program some cool aerial, water and land movement stunts, right in the app.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Users can control the hovercraft with the help of the app via bluetooth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The Codey Rocky</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Codey Rocky is a coding companion for children. It is a stand-alone remote controller with more than 10 advanced electronic modules. Children can learn coding with the help of simple drag-and-drop, graphical programming modules (Scratch Programming). They can access the electronic modules by writing their own programs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rocky is the vehicle to transport Codey anywhere!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Codey Rocky is the perfect tool for kids to transform ideas for practical use through codes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":5} -->
<h5 class="wp-block-heading">The mBot</h5>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The amazing world of robots gets a real foothold with cute, economic mBots. Students can build robotics projects quickly with the help of mBots and a Scratch-based programming software, mBlock.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>mBots are optimized for classroom learning. Students can also operate them offline by translating Scratch codes to&nbsp;<a href="https://kiddypi-online.teachable.com/p/adruino-electronics-level-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Arduino</strong></a>&nbsp;codes and finally uploading them to in-built Arduino boards.&nbsp;</p>
